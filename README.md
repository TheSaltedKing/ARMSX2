# ARMSX2

ARMSX2 is a free and open-source PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulator for ARM devices based on PCSX2 and PCSX2_ARM64. Its purpose is to emulate the PS2's hardware for ARM devices, using a recompiler that operates as x86 -> arm64, not native arm64, this is subject to change as development continues. ARMSX2 allows you to play PS2 games on your mobile android phone, as well as on iOS and MacOS devices.

# Project Details

ARMSX2 began after years of there being no open source PS2 emulator for ARM systems, and so developer MoonPower with the support of jpolo1224 decided to try their hand at porting a new PS2 emulator for Android, forking from the repository PCSX2_ARM64 by developer Pontos. Moon has and will continue doing his best to fill in the gaps and make this into a complete emulator, with the goal to have version parity with PCSX2. This project is not officially associated with PCSX2, and we are not associated with any other forks made from the original repository. This is our own attempt at continuing PS2 emulation on Android, iOS, and MacOS. The emulator currently operates as x86 -> arm64, not native arm64, so the performance may not be as good as AetherSX2 currently, however things are subject to change as development goes on.

# System Requirements

ARMSX2 supports any ARM capable device, including Android, iOS, Linux,and Mac platforms, (Windows ARM should work as well). Please note that performance will also depend on your devices hardware capabilities, we have done our best to optimize for low end devices and will continue to do so.

Please note that a BIOS dump from a legitimately-owned PS2 console is required to use the emulator.
